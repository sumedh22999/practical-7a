<p>One of the most famous and the most loved cartoon series globally, Tom and Jerry never cease to amaze its fans even today. Many of you might not know this but Tom and Jerry started a long time ago. The animated series was created in 1940 by<span style="background-color:#D6EE0E"> William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.</span>

Hanna and Barbera were part of the MGM cartoon studio since the early 1930s. When MGM took a hit with their Captain and the Kids comic strip, Barbera and Hanna were brought together to direct films for the unit. Barbera, being the storyteller, suggested a cat-and-mouse cartoon comedy and named it Puss Gets the Boot. Even though the other members of the unit didn’t think of this as an original idea, Barbera and Hanna went ahead with it.
As they never believed Puss Gets the Boot to be a good idea, Hanna and Barbera went ahead to direct non-cat-and-mouse shorts like <span style="background-color:#D6EE0E">the Gallopin’ Gals (1940) and Officer Pooch (1941). </span>But everything changed when Puss Gets the Boot began to be constantly shown in theaters and also received a nomination for the “Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons” (1941). Even though it didn’t receive the award, MGM animation studio urged Hanna and Barbera to continue with their cat-and-mouse idea. They directed and produced 115 shorts for the animated series during its first run. Moreover, Hanna also went on to offer the vocal effects of the comic duo, Tom and Jerry, who didn’t speak much except occasionally.
